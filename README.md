Certainly! Let's break down the MATLAB class into its constituent parts, providing explanations followed by the corresponding code snippets. This class is designed for an image compression app, demonstrating how to use MATLAB's App Designer for GUI-based applications.

### Class Definition

**Class Declaration:**
This line defines `ImageCompression` as a class that inherits from `matlab.apps.AppBase`, allowing it to use App Designer's functionalities.

```matlab
classdef ImageCompression < matlab.apps.AppBase
```

### Properties Section

**Public Properties:**
These properties are accessible from outside the class and correspond to the UI components like figures, buttons, labels, etc.

```matlab
properties (Access = public)
    UIFigure             matlab.ui.Figure
    SizeLabel_4          matlab.ui.control.Label
    SizeLabel_3          matlab.ui.control.Label
    SizeLabel_2          matlab.ui.control.Label
    SizeLabel            matlab.ui.control.Label
    JPEGLabel            matlab.ui.control.Label
    jpegLABELsize        matlab.ui.control.Label
    SPIHTLabel           matlab.ui.control.Label
    ezwLabel             matlab.ui.control.Label
    start_JPEGButton     matlab.ui.control.Button
    LABLE_og             matlab.ui.control.Label
    SPIHT                matlab.ui.control.Label
    EZW                  matlab.ui.control.Label
    sizeoforiginalLabel  matlab.ui.control.Label
    start_SPIHT          matlab.ui.control.Button
    STARTEZWButton       matlab.ui.control.Button
    getImageButton       matlab.ui.control.Button
    UIAxes_SPIHT         matlab.ui.control.UIAxes
    UIAxes_JPEG          matlab.ui.control.UIAxes
    UIAxes_ezw           matlab.ui.control.UIAxes
    UIAxes_og            matlab.ui.control.UIAxes
end
```

**Private Properties:**
These properties are internal to the class, not accessible from outside. They are used for storing data that doesn't need to be exposed to the app's users.

```matlab
properties (Access = private)
    size_og % Description
end
```

### Callback Methods

**getImageButtonPushed:**
This method is triggered when the "Get Image" button is pressed. It opens a dialog to select an image file, reads and displays the image, and shows its size.

```matlab
function getImageButtonPushed(app, event)
    % Open a file dialog to select an image file
    [filename, pathname] = uigetfile('*.*', 'Select an Image File');
    filename = strcat(pathname, filename);
    a = imread(filename);
    % Display the image in UIAxes_og
    imshow(a, 'Parent', app.UIAxes_og);
    % Get and display the file size
    fileInfo = dir(filename);
    fileSizeBytes = fileInfo.bytes;
    fileSizeKB1 = fileSizeBytes / 1024; % Convert to KB
    fileSizeStr = [num2str(fileSizeKB1) 'kb'];
    app.sizeoforiginalLabel.Text = fileSizeStr;
end
```

**STARTEZWButtonPushed:**
When the "START EZW" button is clicked, it compresses the image using the EZW algorithm, calculates various metrics, and updates the GUI with these details.

```matlab
function STARTEZWButtonPushed(app, event)
    global a;
    tic;
    a = imresize(a, [256 256]);
    [CR,BPP]= wcompress('c',a,'mask.wtc','ezw','maxloop',12);
    Xc=wcompress('u','mask.wtc');
    imwrite(a, 'EZW_image.jpg');
    % Display the image and update the GUI with compression details
    % [Similar to the code snippet provided]
end
```

**start_SPIHTPushed:**
This method compresses the image using SPIHT algorithm upon pressing the "START SPIHT" button. It also calculates and displays compression metrics.

```matlab
function start_SPIHTPushed(app, event)
    % Compression and metrics calculation for SPIHT
    % [Similar to the STARTEZWButtonPushed method]
end
```

**start_JPEGButtonPushed:**
Triggered by the "start_JPEG" button, it compresses the image using JPEG compression and updates the GUI with the compression details.

```matlab
function start_JPEGButtonPushed(app, event)
    % JPEG compression and metrics calculation
    % [Similar to the STARTEZWButtonPushed method, with JPEG-specific details]
end
```

### Component Initialization and App Creation

**createComponents:**
Initializes the app's UI components (figures, buttons, labels, etc.). This method is called during the app construction to set up the GUI layout.

```matlab
function createComponents(app)
    % Create and configure components
    % [Code that initializes each component, setting positions, labels, and callbacks]
end
```

**App Constructor:**
Constructs the app by setting up UI components and registering the app.

```matlab
function app = ImageCompression
   
```matlab
    createComponents(app)
    registerApp(app, app.UIFigure)
    if nargout == 0
        clear app
    end
end
```
- This section of the constructor finishes setting up the app. It calls `createComponents` to initialize the UI components, registers the app with the App Designer framework using `registerApp`, and clears the app variable if no output is required.

**Destructor:**

```matlab
function delete(app)
    delete(app.UIFigure)
end
```
- The destructor ensures that when an instance of the `ImageCompression` app is deleted, its main UI figure is also properly disposed of. This helps in managing the app's lifecycle and in releasing resources.

### Explanation and Summary

The `ImageCompression` app defined in the provided code showcases a practical application of MATLAB's App Designer for image processing tasks. The class structure is well-organized into properties (both public for UI components and private for internal data), callback methods responding to user interactions, component initialization for setting up the GUI, and app lifecycle management through the constructor and destructor.

Each method is designed to handle specific user actions:
- **`getImageButtonPushed`** allows users to select and display an image, showing its file size.
- **`STARTEZWButtonPushed`**, **`start_SPIHTPushed`**, and **`start_JPEGButtonPushed`** are designed to compress the image using different algorithms (EZW, SPIHT, and JPEG respectively), displaying the compressed image, and updating the GUI with metrics such as compression ratio, bits per pixel, mean squared error, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and the compression time.

The use of global variables like `a` (for storing the original image) and `fileSizeKB1` (for storing the original file size in kilobytes) facilitates data sharing between these methods. However, an object-oriented approach could further encapsulate these into the class properties, improving data handling and making the code more modular.

This comprehensive structure not only facilitates learning about GUI development in MATLAB but also offers a practical understanding of image compression techniques and their implementation.
